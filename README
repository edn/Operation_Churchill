To solve a problem dealing with lack of access to the web and applications on a computer we have developed a program which uses computer vision to see where the user places their hands/ parts of body to run scripts/start applications. 

Current issues: 

Out of bounds error. 

Lack of proper sensitivity regarding button push

Lack of proper comment/markup

Instructions:

1. Place hand over button to activate website/program 
2. hold the R or G button to arrange buttons place on the screen for a more ergonomic setup.
