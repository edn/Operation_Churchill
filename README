To solve a problem dealing with lack of access to the web and applications on a computer we have developed a program which uses computer vision to see where the user places their hands/ parts of body to run scripts/start applications. 

Current issues: 

Out of bounds error. 

Need way to go back one track.

Have to manually change computer key commands because Robot cannot handle COMMAND key.

Instructions:

1. Click and drag buttons around screen to customize placement for a more ergonomic setup. 

2. Place hand over right button to launch iTunes on a Mac.

3. Use left button to play/pause track.

4. Use right button to skip to next track.
